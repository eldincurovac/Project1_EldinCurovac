      <p>
        Throughout the CV you can find out that I am very
        <strong
          >sociable, communicative, open and a person willing to work both alone
          and with a group of people,</strong
        >
        in a team. My two biggest interests are <strong>programming</strong> and
        <strong>social interaction</strong>
        with people. I find that there are many jobs that just connect these two
        interests of mine. I find that I have an advantage because I speak and
        write English fluently, but I also understand Turkish. In addition, my
        mother tongue is Bosnian, and therefore I speak and write Serbian,
        Croatian and Montenegrin fluently.
